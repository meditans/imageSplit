* Image split
My brother needed a simple tool to cut horizontal stripes from scanned textbooks
(for example, theorems or particular concepts) in order to be able to create a
deck for spaced repetition software (e.g. anki), simplifying the recall of
mathematical results over time.

Be sure to have =ImageMagick= and =glut= installed. The program doensn't take
any arguments, searches in the directory in which it's invoked =.png= files of
the form =NumberOtherstuff.png=, like =000dynamicalSystems.png= and reads them
in sequential order.

As an example you can try the invocation =stack exec imageSplit-exe= in the
folder of the project, which containes a pre-converted two-pages document.
Here's an example of what you can do (the highlighted areas will become
standalone =.png= files when you cut them):

#+CAPTION: Interface example
[[./images/example.png]]

You can use the left mouse button to set new cuts, right mouse button to delete
the nearest cut, =+= and =-= to zoom, up and down arrow to move. When you're
done with a page, press =Enter= to save the cuts as standalone =.png= images,
and go to the next/previous page with the right/left arrow.

The results for the cut in the previous image are the two images:

#+CAPTION: First cut
[[./images/1typesScottNumerals.png_cut1.png]]

and

#+CAPTION: Second cut
[[./images/1typesScottNumerals.png_cut2.png]]

This tools is developed for personal use, so it's rough at the egdes, but if you
find it useful and want to get more documentation or fixes, get in touch!
